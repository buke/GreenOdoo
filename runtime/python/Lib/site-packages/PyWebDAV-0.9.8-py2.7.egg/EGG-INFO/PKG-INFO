Description: 
        WebDAV library for python.
        
        Consists of a *server* that is ready to run
        Serve and the DAV package that provides WebDAV server(!) functionality.
        
        Currently supports
        
            * WebDAV level 1
            * Level 2 (LOCK, UNLOCK)
            * Experimental iterator support
        
        It plays nice with
        
            * Mac OS X Finder
            * Windows Explorer
            * iCal
            * cadaver
            * Nautilus
        
        This package does *not* provide client functionality.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        After installation of this package you will have a new script in you
        $PYTHON/bin directory called *davserver*. This serves as the main entry point
        to the server.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Example (using easy_install)::
        
            easy_install PyWebDAV
            davserver -D /tmp -n
        
        Example (unpacking file locally)::
        
            tar xvzf PyWebDAV-$VERSION.tar.gz
            cd pywebdav
            python setup.py develop
            davserver -D /tmp -n

        0.9.8 (March 25 2011)
        ---------------------
        
        Restructured. Moved DAV package to pywebdav.lib. All integrators must simply replace
        ''from DAV'' imports to ''from pywebdav.lib''.
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Remove BufferingHTTPServer, reuse the header parser of BaseHTTPServer.

        0.9.3 (July 2 2009)
        -------------------
        
        Setting WebDAV v2 as default because LOCK and UNLOCK seem

        Make propfind respect the depth from queries
        [Cedric Krier]
        
        Add ETag in the header of GET. This is needed to implement 
        GroupDAV, CardDAV and CalDAV.
        [Cedric Krier]
        
        Handle the "Expect 100-continue" header

        a real python package. Adapted error messages. Prepared
        egg distribution.
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Fix for time formatting bug. Thanks to Ian Kallen
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Small fixes for WebDavServer (status not handled correctly) and
        propfind (children are returned from a PROPFIND with "Depth: 0")
        [Kjetil Irbekk]
        
        0.8 (Jul 15th 2008)
        -------------------
        
        First try of an implementation of the LOCK and UNLOCK features.
        Still very incomplete (read: very incomplete) and not working
        in this version.
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Some code cleanups to prepare restructuring
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Port to minidom because PyXML isn't longer maintained
        [Martin v. Loewis]
        
        utils.py: Makes use of DOMImplementation class to create a new xml document
        Uses dom namespace features to create elements within DAV: namespace
        [Stephane Bonhomme]
        
        davcmd.py: Missing an indent in loop on remove and copy operations on trees, the
        effect was that only the last object was removed/copied : always leads
        to a failure when copying collections.
        [Stephane Bonhomme]
        
        propfind.py: missing a return at the end of the createResponse method (case of a
        propfind without xml body, should act as a allprops).
        [Stephane Bonhomme]
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        Added MySQL auth support brought by Vince Spicer
        Added INI file support also  introduced by Vince
        Some minor bugfixes and integration changes.
        Added instance counter to make multiple instances possible
        Extended --help text a bit
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        Added bugfixes for buggy Mac OS X Finder implementation
        Finder tries to stat .DS_Store without checking if it exists
        Cleaned up readme and install files
        Moved license to extra file
        Added distutils support
        Refactored module layout
        Refactored class and module names
        Added commandline support
        Added daemonize support
        Added logging facilities
        Added extended arguments
        
        some more things I can't remember
        [Simon Pamies]
        
        Changes since 0.5.1
        -------------------
        Updated to work with latest 4Suite
        
        Changes since 0.5
        -----------------
        
        added constants.py 
        data.py must now return COLLECTION or OBJECT when getting asked for
        resourcetype. propfind.py will automatically generate the right xml 
        element.
        <href> now only contains the path
        changed HTTP/1.0 header to HTTP/1.1 which makes it work with WebFolders
        added DO_AUTH constant to AuthServer.py to control whether authentication
        should be done or not.
        added chunked responses in davserver.py
        One step in order to get a server with keep-alive one day.
        we now use 4DOM instead if PyDOM
        the URI in a href is quoted
        complete rewrite of the PROPFIND stuff:
        error responses are now generated when a property if not found or not accessible
        namespace handling is now better. We forget any prefix and create them ourselves later in the response.
        added superclass iface.py in DAV/ in order to make implementing
        interface classes easier. See data.py for how to use it.
        Also note that the way data.py handles things might have changed from
        the previous release (if you don't like it wait for 1.0!)
        added functions to iface.py which format creationdate and lastmodified
        implemented HEAD
        
        lots of bugfixes
        
        Changes since 0.3
        -----------------
        
        removed hard coded base uri from davserver.py and replaced by
        a reference to the dataclass. Added this to iface.py where you
        have to define it in your subclass.
        added davcmd.py which contains utility functions for copy and move
        reimplemented DELETE and removed dependencies to pydom. move actual
        delete method to davcmd.
        implemented COPY
        implemented MOVE
        fixed bugs in errors.py, needs revisiting anyway..
        URIs are now unquoted in davserver.py before being used
        paths in data.py are quoted in system calls in order to support
        blanks in pathnames (e.g. mkdir '%s' )
        switched to exceptions when catching errors from the interface class
        added exists() method to data.py
        added more uri utility functions to utils.py
        millenium bugfixes ;-)
