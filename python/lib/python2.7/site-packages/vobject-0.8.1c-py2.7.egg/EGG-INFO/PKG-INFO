Description: Description
        -----------
        
        Parses iCalendar and vCard files into Python data structures, decoding the relevant encodings. Also serializes vobject data structures to iCalendar, vCard, or (experimentally) hCalendar unicode strings.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Requires python 2.4 or later, dateutil (http://labix.org/python-dateutil) 1.1 or later.
        
        Recent changes
        --------------
           - Make change_tz.py compatible with python 2.4, so the entire package stays compatible
           - Fall back to default (the most recent standard) behavior if a VCARD
             or VCALENDAR doesn't have a recognized VERSION
           - Fixed a bad performance bug when parsing large text bodies, thanks to Morgen Sagen at Apple
           - Changed license to Apache 2.0 from Apache 1.1
           - Worked around an issue with Apple Address Book's vcard PHOTO parser
           - Added change_tz module and script for quickly changing event timezones for an
             ics file.  Requires PyICU.
           - Add support for BYMONTHDAY=-1 (days before the end of the month) when setting rrules
             from a dateutil rrule
           - Tolerate a Ruby iCalendar library escaping semi-colons in RRULEs
           - Make vobjects pickle-able
           - Add introspection help for IPython so tab completion works with
             vobject's custom __getattr__
           - Allow Outlook's technically illegal use of commas in TZIDs
           - Allow unicode names for TZIDs
           - Worked around Lotus Notes use of underscores in names by just silently replacing
             with dashes
           - When allowing quoted-printable data, honor CHARSET for each line, defaulting to
             iso-8859-1
           - Simplified directory layout, unit tests are now available via setup.py test
